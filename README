Making this very rudimentary for basic use. I tried to keep this very well commented so look through the code (will generate docs later) for details.

[INSTALL]
$ python setup.py install

[BASIC EXAMPLE]
# after already navigating into the directory that holds yipit.py

import yipit

api = yipit.Api(api_key = "mykeyasdfasdfasdfasdfasd9fa9sfa9s")

deals = api.get_deals(lat=-100.2, 
                      lon=144.444, 
		      radius=20, 
		      divison=["new-york"], 
		      source=["groupon","living-social"], 
		      phone=[2123335555], 
		      tag=['restaurants','bar-club'],
		      paid=True,
		      limit=5000) # all are optional params

individ_deal = api.get_deal_by_id(deal_id = 16721)

for deal in deals:
    print deal.title
    print deal.url
    print deal.yipit_title
    print deal.yipit_url
    print deal.active 
    print deal.business # dictionary with the business information
    print deal.date_added 
    print deal.division # dictionary with division information
    print deal.end_date
    print deal.id
    print deal.images # dictionary with 'image_big' and 'image_small'
    print deal.mobile_url
    print deal.discount # dictionary with 'formatted' and 'raw'
    print deal.price # dictionary with 'formatted' and 'raw'
    print deal.value # dictionary with 'formatted' and 'raw'
    print deal.purchased 
    print deal.source # will be a dictionary of the source
    print deal.tags # will be a list of tag dictionaries

TODO:
	* Api class
	  - fill out all methods
	    TODO get_divisions()
	    TODO get_sources()
	    TODO get_tags()
	* Deal class
	  - finish/fill out
	* Source class
	  - DO IT FOR SOURCES API
	* Division class
	  - DO IT
	* Tag class
	  - JUST DO IT
	* Business class
