Making this very rudimentary for basic use. I tried to keep this very well commented so look through the code (will generate docs later) for details.

** Look at yipit_test.py for more examples of how to use this wrapper

[INSTALL]
$ python setup.py install

[BASIC EXAMPLE]
# after already navigating into the directory that holds yipit.py

import yipit
